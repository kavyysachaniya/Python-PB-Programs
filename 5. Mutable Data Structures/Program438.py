"""

A digital image in a computer is represented by a pixels matrix.
Each image processing operation in a computer may be
observed as an operation on the image matrix. Suppose
you are given an N x N 2D matrix A (in the form of a list)
representing an image. Write a Python program to
rotate this image by 90 degrees (clockwise) by
rotating the matrix 90 degree clockwise.
Write proper code to take input
of N from the user and then to take input of an
N x N matrix from the
user. Rotate the matrix by 90 degree clockwise and
then print the rotated matrix.

Note: You are not allowed to use an extra iterable like list,
tuple, etc. to do this. You need to make changes in the given
list A itself. Your program should be able to handle any N x N
matrix from N = 1 to N = 20.
